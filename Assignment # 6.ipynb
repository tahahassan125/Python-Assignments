    "## There are following Benefits of Pbject Oriented Programming(OOP):\n",
    "  ### 1. Problems solving : Decomposing a complex problem into smaller chunks or discrete components is a good practice. OOP is specialized in this behavior, as it breaks down your software code into bite-sized – one object at a time.\n",
    "  ### 2. Security : With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "  ### 3. Polymorphism Flexibility : Let’s see a scenario to better explain this behavior.You behave in a different way if the place or surrounding gets change. A person will behave like a customer if he is in a market, the same person will behave like a student if he is in a school and as a son/daughter if put in a house. Here we can see that the same person showing different behavior every time the surroundings are changed. This means polymorphism is flexibility and helps developers in a number of ways.\n",
    "  ### 4. Code Maintenance : This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.\n",
    "  ### 5. Re-usability : It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. This is done with the use of a class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need.\n",

    "### Class :  Is a blueprint for creating an object. Think of a builder who wants to create a building of some type. The builder uses a blueprint to ensure that the building will meet the required specifications. Likewise, Python usesclasses as a blueprint for creating new objects.\n",
    "### Object :  Defines a unique instance of a class. The object contains all the methods and properties of the original class. However, the data for each object differs. The storage locations are unique, even if the data is the same.\n",
    "### Attribute : There are two attributes in python:\n",
    "#### 1. Class Attribute : A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,...), of the class. \n",
    "#### 2. Instance Attribute : An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class.\n",
    "### Behavior : A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them\n"
